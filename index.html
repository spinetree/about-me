            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I'm Steve Rokitka (aka Steve Rocketkar). Product designer, UI/UX designer, design-usability-content
                unicorn - however you'd like to say it, I've been building tools and experiences for over a decade.</p>

            <p>When I'm not crafting various parts of the internet, I go on adventures. In the last
                couple years I've painted a house, rode a motorcycle to Burning Man, took a Wilderness First Responder
                course, learned to fix cars at a community college, and continued my training in various martial arts.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Right now I'm looking to update my somewhat-atrophied coding skills and learn enough Javascript that I
                can transition from product design to a full-stack dev-signer, UI developer or design technologist.
                Above all, I really just want to build cool stuff from coffee shops and not have to go into an office
                every day.</p>
